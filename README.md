Collaborate with your friends
=============================

You will learn how we collaborate with Git. We will use this repository for a centralized repository. 
Here is what will you do.

### exercise 3
* please create folder named `learn-git-centralized`
* go into that folder, and initialize empty git repository
* add remote repository `git@github.com:yunanhelmy/learn-git.git`
* 1 of you will add new file index.html in local brach (short-lived branch), add lorem ipsum text, commit and push to this branch
* the others will pull

### exercise 4
Great! Now you are using your friend's code. Now, we will learn to resolve the conflict.
* create list of city in Indonesia (just 4 line is enough)
* add, commit, and push
* some of you can't push it because you are 1 ahead from current commit
* pull your friend's changes
* there are conflict and you must resolve it before pushing again
* use one of the code version. there are 2 version, HEAD is yours and hash is others commit
* resolve it and push
